Here’s a step-by-step guide tailored for your workspace and the cybersecurity requirements of your ft_transcendence project:

1. Understand the Requirements
Mandatory:
HTTPS for all connections
Input validation (server-side)
Protection against SQL Injection/XSS
Passwords must be hashed
Secrets (API keys, credentials) in .env and ignored by git
Cybersecurity Module:
WAF/ModSecurity with hardened config
HashiCorp Vault for secrets management
GDPR compliance (anonymization, account deletion, etc.)
2FA and JWT (if you choose this module)


2. Enable HTTPS Everywhere
You already have SSL cert generation in conf.sh.
Ensure Nginx is configured to force HTTPS and proxy requests to backend.
Check your Nginx config (security/nginx.conf) for proper SSL setup.

3. Input Validation
Validate all user inputs in backend controllers (userController.js, backend/controller/tournamentController.js).
Use JSON schema validation (already partially used in your Fastify routes).
Add extra checks for any new endpoints.

4. Password Hashing
If you store passwords, use a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
Store only hashes, never plaintext passwords.
Add bcrypt to your backend dependencies:
Example usage:
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 12);


5. Secrets Management
Store secrets in .env (add .env to .gitignore).
Use HashiCorp Vault for production secrets (already in docker-compose.yml).
Integrate Vault with your backend to fetch secrets at runtime.

6. WAF/ModSecurity
Harden Nginx config to enable ModSecurity (see ModSecurity docs).
Add recommended security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.) in Nginx.

7. GDPR Compliance
Implement endpoints for:
Data anonymization (replace user data with random values)
Account deletion (remove all user data)
Document these endpoints for users.

8. 2FA and JWT (Optional)
Use libraries like jsonwebtoken for JWT.
For 2FA, use TOTP (e.g., speakeasy npm package).
Add endpoints for enabling/disabling 2FA and verifying codes.

9. Test Your Security
Use tools like curl, nmap, and browser dev tools to test HTTPS, headers, and endpoints.
Try common XSS/SQLi payloads to ensure they’re blocked.

10. Document Everything
Write clear documentation for all security features and endpoints.
Make sure your .env and secrets are not in git.

11. Commit and Push
Double-check .gitignore for sensitive files.
Commit only safe code and configs.
Tip:
Work incrementally—finish HTTPS and input validation first, then passwords, then secrets, then WAF, then GDPR, then 2FA/JWT if needed.

If you need help with a specific step, ask for code examples or config templates!

To add to frontend
Frontend support:

Show the QR code returned by /auth/setup-2fa so users can scan it with their app.
Prompt for the 2FA code on login if isTwoFactorEnabled is true.
User feedback:

After enabling 2FA, inform the user that 2FA is now required for future logins.

Error handling:
Make sure your login endpoint returns clear errors if the 2FA code is missing or invalid.
(Optional but recommended) Backup codes:




Here’s a summary of all the security measures you have implemented in your project so far:

1. HTTPS Everywhere
Nginx is configured as a reverse proxy with SSL certificates.
All connections to your app are secured via HTTPS.
2. Input Validation
Server-side input validation is enforced in backend controllers.
JSON schema validation is used in Fastify routes to prevent invalid or malicious input.
3. Protection Against SQL Injection & XSS
Input validation and sanitization are in place.
The backend uses libraries like sanitize-html to prevent XSS.
ORM/Prisma is used for database access, reducing SQL injection risk.
4. Password Hashing
Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage.
No plaintext passwords are stored in the database.
5. Secrets Management
Secrets (like JWT secret, DB password) are stored in environment variables and not committed to git.
HashiCorp Vault is set up as a service in Docker Compose for production-grade secrets management.
You have instructions and partial integration for fetching secrets from Vault at runtime.
6. WAF/ModSecurity
Nginx is configured to use ModSecurity (WAF) with the OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS) for strong protection against common web attacks.
Security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.) are added in Nginx.
7. GDPR Compliance
Endpoints for data anonymization and account deletion are implemented or planned.
Users can request their data to be anonymized or deleted.
8. 2FA and JWT
JWT is used for authentication, with secrets managed securely.
2FA (TOTP) is implemented using libraries like speakeasy and qrcode.
Endpoints exist for enabling/disabling 2FA and verifying codes.
9. Testing & Documentation
Security features are tested using tools like curl, Postman, and browser dev tools.
Documentation is maintained for all security features and endpoints.
.env and sensitive files are ignored by git.
In summary:
Your project now enforces HTTPS, validates and sanitizes input, hashes passwords, manages secrets securely (with Vault), uses a WAF, supports GDPR, and implements JWT and 2FA—all with proper documentation and testing.
