Here’s a step-by-step guide tailored for your workspace and the cybersecurity requirements of your ft_transcendence project:

1. Understand the Requirements
Mandatory:
HTTPS for all connections
Input validation (server-side)
Protection against SQL Injection/XSS
Passwords must be hashed
Secrets (API keys, credentials) in .env and ignored by git
Cybersecurity Module:
WAF/ModSecurity with hardened config
HashiCorp Vault for secrets management
GDPR compliance (anonymization, account deletion, etc.)
2FA and JWT (if you choose this module)


2. Enable HTTPS Everywhere
You already have SSL cert generation in conf.sh.
Ensure Nginx is configured to force HTTPS and proxy requests to backend.
Check your Nginx config (security/nginx.conf) for proper SSL setup.

3. Input Validation
Validate all user inputs in backend controllers (userController.js, backend/controller/tournamentController.js).
Use JSON schema validation (already partially used in your Fastify routes).
Add extra checks for any new endpoints.

4. Password Hashing
If you store passwords, use a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
Store only hashes, never plaintext passwords.
Add bcrypt to your backend dependencies:
Example usage:
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 12);


5. Secrets Management
Store secrets in .env (add .env to .gitignore).
Use HashiCorp Vault for production secrets (already in docker-compose.yml).
Integrate Vault with your backend to fetch secrets at runtime.

6. WAF/ModSecurity
Harden Nginx config to enable ModSecurity (see ModSecurity docs).
Add recommended security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.) in Nginx.

7. GDPR Compliance
Implement endpoints for:
Data anonymization (replace user data with random values)
Account deletion (remove all user data)
Document these endpoints for users.

8. 2FA and JWT (Optional)
Use libraries like jsonwebtoken for JWT.
For 2FA, use TOTP (e.g., speakeasy npm package).
Add endpoints for enabling/disabling 2FA and verifying codes.

9. Test Your Security
Use tools like curl, nmap, and browser dev tools to test HTTPS, headers, and endpoints.
Try common XSS/SQLi payloads to ensure they’re blocked.

10. Document Everything
Write clear documentation for all security features and endpoints.
Make sure your .env and secrets are not in git.

11. Commit and Push
Double-check .gitignore for sensitive files.
Commit only safe code and configs.
Tip:
Work incrementally—finish HTTPS and input validation first, then passwords, then secrets, then WAF, then GDPR, then 2FA/JWT if needed.

If you need help with a specific step, ask for code examples or config templates!

const jwtSecret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;
const dbPassword = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;

npx prisma migrate dev --name password_hash
npm install bcrypt
npm install jsonwebtoken
npm install sanitize-html
npm install speakeasy qrcode
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_2fa_fields
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libnginx-mod-security
sudo systemctl restart nginx
docker run --cap-add=IPC_LOCK -d --name=dev-vault -p 8200:8200 vault
npm install node-vault
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_backup_codes






export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
vault operator init
vault operator unseal
vault login <root_token>

What else should you add for a functional 2FA flow?
Frontend support:

Show the QR code returned by /auth/setup-2fa so users can scan it with their app.
Prompt for the 2FA code on login if isTwoFactorEnabled is true.
User feedback:

After enabling 2FA, inform the user that 2FA is now required for future logins.
Error handling:

Make sure your login endpoint returns clear errors if the 2FA code is missing or invalid.
(Optional but recommended) Backup codes:

Offer backup codes for account recovery if the user loses access to their authenticator app.
